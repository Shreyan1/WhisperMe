## Getting Started :

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shreyan1/WhisperMe.git
   cd WhisperMe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch WhisperMe [on Linux and MacOS]**

   ```
   cd GUI Version
   ./run_GUI.sh
   ```

## Things to Know before your take-off :

This repository contains 2 versions of the same code logic - 
- **USE-in-CODE** : This version contains the code logic with all functionalities in a manner that can be re-used in your code by just basic integration and calling.
- **GUI Version** :  This packs a graphical user interface designed using Tkinter library to use it across all platforms. This GUI version has 2 pairs of special .sh/.bat files namely - clear_logs.sh/.bat and run_GUI.sh/.bat.

Let's understand what they do - 
- **clear_logs.sh/.bat** : This handles the automatic deletion of all the log files inside the log folder in a second, which could otherwise take a long time when multiple logs have been generated and have caused an overpopulation inside the folder resulting into a disk space issue.
- **run_GUI.sh/.bat** : This performs the direct execution of the GUI.py file without manually opening it and executing it through an editor/terminal, thus giving a software like UX while interacting with the GUI.

There is also a folder with Example Transcripts generated using this repo code by transcribing multilingual audio files for - 
- Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Tamil

Check it out to view the power of the Whisper Model.

## Usage :

1. **Start WhisperMe**: Run the `run_GUI.sh` script to launch the application.
2. **Record Live/ Select Audio File**: Click on `Start Recording` to record live and save it as a .wav file or `Transcribe Now` to select the audio file you wish to transcribe.
3. **Transcription**: Wait for the transcription to complete. A "Please wait" message will display during this process.
4. **Save Transcript**: Once transcription is complete, choose where to save your transcript file.
